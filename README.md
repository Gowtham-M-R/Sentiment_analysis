# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

The Movie Review Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews using natural language processing techniques. By leveraging the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library for text processing, this project provides insights into public sentiment towards movies.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: This project employs sophisticated natural language processing techniques to classify movie reviews into one of three categories: positive, negative, or average. This allows users to gain a deeper understanding of the overall sentiment expressed in the reviews.

- **Visualization**: Sentiment analysis results are visualized using both bar plots and linear graphs. These visualizations offer a clear representation of the sentiment distribution among the movie reviews, making it easier to interpret and analyze the data.

- **Insights into Public Sentiment**: By analyzing movie reviews, the project offers insights into public sentiment towards specific movies or the film industry as a whole. This information can be valuable for filmmakers, producers, distributors, and movie buffs in understanding audience reactions and making informed decisions.

## Prerequisites
